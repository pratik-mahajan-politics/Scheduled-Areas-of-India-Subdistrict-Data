# Scheduled-Areas-of-India-Subdistrict-Data
The dataset is an original compilation of lists released by the Fifth Scheduled states in their Annual Reports on Scheduled Areas, up until 2012. For Sixth Scheduled states, I refer to the post 1986 division of the state of Assam and the subsequent subdistricts that today come under Sixth Scheduled Areas.
